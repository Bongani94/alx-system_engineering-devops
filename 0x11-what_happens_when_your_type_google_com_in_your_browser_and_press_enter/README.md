* ** Think of the Domain Name System (DNS) like the phonebook of the internet!

Each device connected to the internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device.

* Internet Protocol Suite
* ** Finally the browser knows where to find www.google.com and it’s now time to make a connection, to access the website requested. Browsers use internet protocols to build such connections.

* SSL
* ** Security is key in nowadays digital world so we have an extra security measure taken using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

* HTTP/HTTPS
* **  HTTP client or web browser sends a request message to an HTTP server or web server. The server, in turn, returns a response message. Note that HTTP is a pull protocol, the client pulls information from the server rather than the server pushes information to the client.
* ** HTTPS works the same as HTTP , it’s only more secure. The additional letter, S, stands for security, and, as mentioned earlier, it means it’s using a SSL certificate.

* Database
* ** Another crucial component in the client-server computing environment is the database server, which consists of hardware and software that run a database.

* Conclusion
* ** All of these steps mentioned above happen within milliseconds that we press Enter on our keyboard, before we can even notice them.
