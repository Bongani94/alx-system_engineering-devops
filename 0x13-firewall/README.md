# 0x13. Firewall

## What is a FIREWALL
* ``A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet``. A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.
